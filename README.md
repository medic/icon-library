## About the Icon Library

This collection of 60+ free icons was developed by the Medic Mobile team to represent key elements of different community health workflows and protocols. While these icons were designed primarily for community health apps built with the Community Health Toolkit's [Core Framework](https://github.com/medic/medic.github.io/blob/master/resource-overviews/core-framework-overview.pdf), they can also be used in a variety of communication efforts.

The [forms_tasks_targets](https://github.com/medic/icon-library/tree/master/forms_tasks_targets) folder includes PNG and SVG icons related to diseases and conditions, treatments and proceedures, community members and health professionals, and abstract concepts like learning and health equity. The [people_and_places](https://github.com/medic/icon-library/tree/master/people_and_places) folder contains icons that address health system heirarchies, like districts, health facilities, families, and individuals.

NOTE: We recommend using SVG icons within your health app due to their smaller size. Additionally, if you are using medic-conf to upload resources, make sure you add the correct icons for people and places to your `resources.json` file. Otherwise, uploading resources will inadvertently remove your people and place icons. An issue is being raised in medic-conf to solve this. You'll need to define `medic-clinic`, `medic-health-center`, `medic-district-hospital` and `medic-person` in your `resources.json` and set them to the appropriate SVG files.

To learn more about which icons can be used for which use cases and workflows within your community health app, review the Medic Mobile Design Team's [best practices](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vWTL9RCnMK-_jFVbQeIlIZIkfyw4DVTO-lxu6vCHieo/edit#heading=h.wlx8vh5tj0p4) for selecting and using icons in configuration.
